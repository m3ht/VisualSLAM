# Improving Data Association in Vision-based SLAM

## Overview
This repository contains the source code that replicates the paper on "Improving Data Association in Vision-based SLAM." The paper presents an approach to vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The approach uses the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) as features and applies a rejection technique to concentrate on a reduced set of distinguishable, stable features.
